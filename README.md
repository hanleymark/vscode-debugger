# VSCode Debugger Demo

This is a simple project to demonstrate the usage of VSCode debugging tools to the FAC29B cohort as part of their full-stack web development Bootcamp.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in VSCode.
3. Set breakpoints in the code where you want to pause and inspect the variables.
4. Start the debugging session by clicking on the "Run and Debug" button in the VSCode sidebar.
5. Select the appropriate debug configuration.
6. Trigger the code execution that will hit the breakpoints.
7. Use the debugging tools in VSCode to step through the code, inspect variables, and analyze the program flow.

## Debugging Tips

Here are some tips to make the most out of the VSCode debugging experience:

- Use the "Step Over" button to execute the current line and move to the next line.
- Use the "Step Into" button to step into a function call and debug the code inside the function.
- Use the "Step Out" button to step out of the current function and return to the calling code.
- Use the "Continue" button to resume the execution until the next breakpoint is hit.
- Use the "Watch" panel to monitor the values of variables during debugging.
- Use the "Call Stack" panel to navigate through the function call hierarchy.
